        <p><span class="floating">The story told by Neifile brings to my mind another in
        which also a Jew appears, but this time as the hero of a perilous
        adventure; and as enough has been said of God and of the truth of
        our faith, it will not now be inopportune if we descend to mundane
        events and the actions of men. Wherefore I propose to tell you a
        story, which will perhaps dispose you to be more circumspect than
        you have been wont to be in answering questions addressed to you.
        Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it often
        happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are
        plunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise
        from extremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured
        peace. Of the change from good to evil fortune, which folly may
        effect, instances abound; indeed, occurring as they do by the thousand
        day by day, they are so conspicuous that their recital would
        be beside our present purpose. But that good sense may be our
        succour in misfortune, I will now, as I promised, make plain to you
        within the narrow compass of a little story.</span></p> 
            <p>Saladin, who by his great valour had from small beginnings made
            himself Soldan of <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, and gained many victories over kings both
            Christian and Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish
            displays of magnificence spent all his treasure, and in order to meet
            a certain emergency being in need of a large sum of money, and
            being at a loss to raise it with a celerity adequate to his necessity,
            bethought him of a wealthy Jew, Melchisedech by name, who lent
            at usance in <span class="placeName">Alexandria</span>, and who, were he but willing, was, as he
            believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly that he would
            never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to constrain him
            thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after pondering
            every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at
            last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting
            the money from him. So he sent for him, received him affably,
            seated him by his side, and presently said to him: <q>My good man, I
                have heard from many people that thou art very wise, and of great
                discernment in divine things; wherefore I would gladly know of thee,
                which of the three laws thou reputest the true law, the law of the
                Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of the Christians?</q> </p>
            <p>The Jew,
            who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that Saladin meant
            to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to harass
            him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws
            above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he
            sought. So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an
            answer as might avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought,
            saying: 
            <q>My lord, a pretty question indeed is this which you propound,
                and fain would I answer it; to which end it is apposite that
                I tell you a story, which, if you will hearken, is as follows: 
                <span class="nested">If I
                mistake not, I remember to have often heard tell of a great and rich
                man of old time, who among other most precious jewels had in his
                treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which by reason
                of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for ever;
                for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found
                in possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate
                his heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and
                homage due to a superior. The son, to whom he bequeathed the
                ring, left it in like manner to his descendants, making the like
                ordinance as his predecessor. In short the ring passed from hand to
                hand for many generations; and in the end came to the hands of
                one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very obedient
                to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. The rule
                touching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and
                each aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he
                could to persuade his father, who was now old, to leave the ring to
                him at his death. The worthy man, who loved them all equally, and
                knew not how to choose from among them a sole legatee, promised
                the ring to each in turn, and in order to satisfy all three, caused a
                cunning artificer secretly to make other two rings, so like the first,
                that the maker himself could hardly tell which was the true ring.
                So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one privily to
                each of his sons; whereby it came to pass, that after his decease each
                of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his
                claim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of
                right. And the rings being found so like one to another that it
                was impossible to distinguish the true one, the suit to determine the
                true heir remained pendent, and still so remains. And so, my lord,
                to your question, touching the three laws given to the three peoples
                by God the Father, I answer: Each of these peoples deems itself to
                have the true inheritance, the true law, the true commandments of
                God; but which of them is justified in so believing, is a question
                which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.</span></q> </p>
            <p>The excellent
            adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare
            which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore
            determined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him
            at the same time what he had intended to do, in the event of his
            answering less circumspectly than he had done.</p>
                <p>Thereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that
                he required, which the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He
                also gave him most munificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a
                great and honourable position near his person.</p></div>
